[{"text": "Ok..little old lady here, whose working life consisted of nothing but years and years of Windows, android phones, etc.  Just in last several years jumped hesitantly into Apple (phone, Ipad mini, etc.)LOVE LOVE LOVE my iPad mini but, thought..might be time to think about replacement..so, I saw the great price on this 10 inch tablet and thought Id take a chance.  I am much more partial to the mini sized tablets, but thought Id go for it...soooo, even after reading all the bu.......t comments here, thought Id try, if i didnt like it., Id return it.  1. Delivered on time, yayyy!  2. Package well protected, sealed, unblemished...perfect condition (and yeah..no fingerprints on  screen)  3. Ipad fired right up...70% charged  4. Ipad immediately began transferring info from iPhone that was sitting nearby.  Yayyyyy!!  No need for  reams of books, booklets, warnings, etc., etc.!!  5. EVERYTHING transferred from iPhone and IPad Mini...and I still had some 15 gig storage left on new  64 gig iPad  (just remember ...this is for my entertainment...not for work with diagrams, idiotic work  related emails about cleaning up my workspace, or 20 specs for items no one will ever use)  6.  Did a test run...everything worked exactly as I required, expected.  7.  Ultimate test...watched old Morse/Poirot shows I have in Prime..excellent quality!  love love love  8.  After 8 full hours...I had to recharge for a bit before I went to bed.  (charged fairly fast!)sooooooo...Im keeping this jewel!!!!!Risk is there...evidently, if you believe the nutso crowd and their comments here.  Its a GREAT item, its a fabulous deal, Christmas is coming...or if you need to have a worthy backup..,...DO IT!!!!",

 {"text": "If you’re anything like me you want something to watch shows on in you living room or bed, but you don’t like the TV, and your phone is too small. Well this is the perfect thing for you, the screen is just the right size and very crisp and clear(maybe better then my iPhone X), the responsiveness is excellent, and all of the streaming sites work with this perfectly. On top of that, my AirPods automatically switch between this and my phone, so I don’t have to worry about messing with the settings every time. However, the camera is only OK. And it feels very delicate, so I would pick up a case and get AppleCare+. The battery isn’t the best either, but should be enough to get through the day. Overall I definitely recommend this, especially for the price.",

 {"text": "My old IPad was acting up, wouldn’t hold a charge etc. This iPad arrived the very next day after I ordered it. What a great surprise. The one corner of the outer box it arrived in was damaged, but the inner box containing the iPad was in perfect condition. It was so simple to transfer everything from my old iPad to this one, just laid the new one on the old (iPad 2019) and it did pretty much everything on its own. I am very pleased with my purchase, I hope it lasts longer than my 2019 model.",

 {"text": "Im not much of an apple product person but I do buy them for people I dont want to provide tech support to. (Parents, In-laws, Wife, and Kids)I used to use the fire tablets because they were cheap and I thought that would keep the kids entertained, especially on road trips. This worked for movies and some games but there were always problems with how slow they become with updates, loss of battery life, etc.This ipad was a game changer.  I always knew they were the best tablets but I was also a bit in denial as well as just being somewhat anti-apple. With this on sale during prime day 2022 (July) I took a chance and bought one for the kids.This does everything as well or better (usually better) than previous tablets I had purchased because they were cheaper.I also didnt buy a case for it and my kids are brutal with these types of devices. To date, it is still in one piece, operational, and has no cracks in the screen.Sometimes it is worth paying a bit more for the name brand product and in this case Im a believer.",

 {"text": "For those who wonder, this is brand new in the box, 2021 9th generation. It is NOT refurbed or an exchange. It is never opened and shrink wrapped by Apple. (See my photos.) The reason it is so much cheaper than the other 2021 iPads is the 64gb storage. But with iCloud so ridiculously cheap for cloud storage, I just cannot see this 64gb as not getting the job done. I myself was curious about this low price buying me a refurb/exchange, but that is simply not the case here. I do, however, recommend you not go with 32gb. I believe even with an iCloud account, you will be sorry you didn’t go 64gb.And the ease of setting this up cannot be understated. I simply sat my iPhone 13 Pro Max next to it and all relevant files and Wi-Fi passwords were transferred over with no input from me. It looked to me that it will do that with Android and most laptops also, though I did not test that out. All photos also came over, and the ones I took after that transfer, I simply Air-Dropped them into this iPad. All in all, this is as simple as it gets for transferring files and photos. Apple has this stuff down to a science, believe me.This screen is incredible. If you are looking at a pre-Retina screen, you will be amazed at this 2021 version. This thing is very fast, the on screen keyboard is fast, accurate and very concise. Dealing with apps is easy, and Apple doesn’t load you down with bloat you’ll never use. It is claimed this has about 12 hours on a charge; what I’ve seen thus far leads me to believe that is accurate.All in all, I am extremely pleased with this purchase. You can’t always say you got what you paid for. But I can definitely say that with this. This is the entry level 2021 9th generation iPad, and it is exactly what I need. Go and get you one…",

 {"text": "I have had an ipad air since they came out.  I used hotel points to get it and its served me well as a book and simple internet use.  Recently I noticed that it was no updating and some of my favorite apps were telling me they were using an old version because my IOS was outdated.  Without being able to update it I decided to pass my old one on and get a new one.  Then I thought Id get a mini 6 but after comparing the prices and the ability I could not justify a double price for it.  I ordered this Ipad 9 and it came quicker than expected.  Out of the box it performs much better than my old one, screen appears clearer and I like the new IOS it uses.  My old one will live on as a small tv for my wife when shes in the kitchen and for that it does very well.  I have no complaints about my new one.  Its easy to talk yourself into the top of the curve, but sometimes being a bit behind it makes better fiscal sense",
